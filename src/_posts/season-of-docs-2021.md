Hi everyone.

In this article, I would like to share the results of my third consecutive year in Season of Docs. This time I was lucky enough to join the [Redocly](https://redoc.ly/gsod#technical-writer-hiring-update) team to work on the OpenAPI-CLI project.

## Completed Work

1. **Updated OpenAPI-CLI Overview page**
  This update brought readers a more clear and concise overview of the OpenAPI-CLI tool and its main features.

    * Revised the page to be more consistent and organized following DRY principle (DRY: Do not repeat yourself)
    * Updated structure of the document to be more better oriented for the first-time readers
    * Removed information about installation as redundant (this information was added to the full-fledged quick start guide)

1. **Created installation guide**
  This update brought a fully-revised page that outlines all the possible installation variants to make it easier for a complete newcomer to start working with the OpenAPI-CLI as quickly as possible. The guide now combines installation methods depending on their type (local or global) listing the recommended ones at the top of the page.

1. **Created quick start guide**
  This update brought a brand new page that inherits the structure from the template (p.3). This page outlines all the steps required for a bot maker to create a bot using the Hubot framework. The essence of the information was taken from two related repositories (one, two), consolidated into several sets of instructions based on the deployment platform (local machine, Docker containers) and supplemented with additional configuration capabilities. Tested the quick start guide instructions by deploying a local instance of the Hubot bot.

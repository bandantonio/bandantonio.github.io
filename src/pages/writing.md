## About

While writing articles is a creative job, technical writing is an art.

It may seem weird, but the well-written documentation can be significantly more efficient and influential on your target audience than different SEO articles coupled with marketing strategies. Why? Probably, because help document is the first thing that your customers want to see (and read) after they have purchased your product in order to find out how the hell it works.

My natural meticulousness and vast technical skills led me to become a technical writer. During 6+ years of my working experience, I have been involved in different variations of this job (creating user manuals, FAQs, step-by-step guides, blog articles/reviews, etc.), which allows me to create eye-catching documents thoughtfully, thoroughly and flawlessly until the last character, making them a truly remarkable handmade art.

In addition, I've been blogging since 2011. It changed my life greatly, not just by improving my writing style, but also by allowing me to discover new knowledge and skills. At this moment, my blog is bilingual, having Russian and English languages on board.

Reading catchy books, blog articles or any other carefully crafted texts is a passion of mine - they make my mind fly. The most magnificent examples are the following:
A book â€œWork for Money, Design for Love" by David Airey
The Verge and MakeUseOf blogs
Vertu and Xiaomi websites

Well, yes, hello... yet again! ðŸ˜„

This post completes my long journey of switching to a new static-site generator as well as marks a new chapter of my blog.

The new static-site generator is called Astro, which I found a few weeks earlier and immediately decided to give it a try. I had my previous setup based on Hexo, but the experience with it was kinda boring. I will share more details about it in a separate post.

Another part of the journey was to stop being lazy ass and start writing something. A few years ago, I created my Zettelkasten, and later on, I noticed that some of the thoughts that might be transformed into articles, in fact, were not. And I'm not sure if it's because I was too lazy, or I was just too busy, maybe both. But anyway, I'm glad that I finally decided to start writing again. There are some thoughts that should be taken out of Zettelkasten and shared publicly, so stay tuned. I'm excited to see where this goes!
